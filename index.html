<section id="about">
  <p>Hello, world. My name is Trevor Howard. I have been playing around with computers since I was a little kid. One of my first memories is of playing Super Mario Bros on my family's NES. I wrote my first program in BASIC in elementary school. By middle school, I had built my first website, using HTML. I have always been the technically inclined one in my social circles or the de-facto "fix-it" guy. Lately, I have been diving head-first into as many lessons on FreeCodeCamp as possible. I also plan to pursue many more lessons and challenges through a medley of other sites, while building up a portfolio. The resources available on-line are staggering and I intend to make the most of them. What an exciting time to be a life-long seeker of knowledge!</p>
